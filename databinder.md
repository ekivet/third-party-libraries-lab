Databinders are used to do pretty much exactly what their name implys.  They take a piece of data set as an object and adhere it directly to a view.  Google came out with this library to make it easier to display data on a screen.  They eliminate the need to declare a view in your activity and manually set it to an xml tag.  Instead, you can tag an object directly in your xml layout and use a binding object in java to display it.  They can prove to be useful in basically any app that displays data on a screen, which is pretty much every app.  The app I made will take any input values you enter into the edit texts and display them in text views below.  The user inputs data which is set to as parameters of a "User" Object and then displayed on the screen. Although I declared the edit texts using standard conventions the text views are only declared in XML, and the databinders reference the object directly.
